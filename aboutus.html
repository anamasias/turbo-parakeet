            <h2>How it started</h2>

                <p>"I started making home made dog treats after watching my own dog, Bambino,
                     watch me everytime I baked anything at home. I thought to myself, why not
                      try to make him something that is completely dog safe and fresh?<br>
                Now I even bake him his own dog safe cake for his birthday every year and even
                 let him sneak in some licks during the baking process (except raw egg!) since 
                 everything is completely safe!" -Ana Masias</p>

            <h2>Our Mission Now</h2>

            <p>Now we wish to share some of the easiest recipes to make at home if you are just 
                starting out baking home made treats. Our first easy recipe to 
                share is <a href="lessonone.html">Peanut Butter Banana Treats.</a></p>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>

            <p>I've gotten a lot of inspirations from others online for many recipes that I have
                done in the past for my dog. One of my favorites was a recipe I followed by Christi,
                which was a dog safe cake! Check it out
